# Swapi API APP
# A React Native App.

 - Redux to manage state.
 - Splitted reducers to handle different states specifically - Used combineRedcers to combine the different reducers so as to act similar to that of a single reducer to make it more readable.
 - Used connect() to connect the React component to a Redux store and then dispatch actions to create the todo.
 - Used action creators and action types for proper code management and better readability.
